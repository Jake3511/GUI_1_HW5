This program is a simple take on Scrabble that utilizes jQuery Plugins to add draggable and droppable features to the program, 
as well as using vanilla JavaScript for some of the more simple functionality of the program like getting a random letter or updating the score. I would say this project was 
super tedious in the sense that there were a bunch of tiny bugs that you had to try to iron out before moving to the next step. Overall, I would say that this project went fairly
well with a few minor hiccups listed below.

Things I struggled with: Creating the seven droppable points to put on the rack, and having it so two letters had to be side by side.
